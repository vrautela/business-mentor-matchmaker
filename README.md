Business-Mentor Matchmaker

This website is to help startups find a mentor to help them in their needed fields. Such as if a startup was struggling with inventory space, finances, and web design. The algorithm in this website will look through a list of mentors, compare keywords within their strengths, and determine a recommendation list of the most suitable mentors to help out.
